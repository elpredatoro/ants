# Ants Simulator

Simple Ants Simulator, written for fun and learning.

Ants leave markers as they move, markers leading to home and markers leading to food. After finding food, the ant returns home and its path is marked as leading to food, from then on other ants can use it. Similarly, returning home.

## TODO

- Sometimes ants stuck in walls
- Optimize path drawing
